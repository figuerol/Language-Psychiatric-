Can Language and Grammar tests detect the prescence of Psychatric disorders?
 I work on a public data set reported in Hartshorne, Tenenbaum, & Pinker. A Critical Period for Second Language Acquisition: Evidence from 2/3 Million English Speakers. This Dataset contains the results of an English language exam given to 600,000 people. The Data has many features from the participants, for example years spent in English speaking country, native language, age, correct answers, presence of psychiatric disorders and many more. While performing EDA on the data set, I found that  individuals which presented psychiatric disorders were very likely to have median to excellent results (staying above the lower threshold of those which did not present psychiatric disorders). Further exploring the data, this observation appears as if it is not by random chance. The individuals with psychiatric disorders appear to be evenly distributed among the categories of education and years living on English speaking countries.
